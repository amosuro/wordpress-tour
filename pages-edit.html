        <h4>Editing a Page</h4>
        <p>This is the Edit Page screen. You'll very quickly become familiar with this section, since it's usually the pages on your site that need the most maintenance!</p>
      </li>

      <li data-text="Next">
        <p>Since there are a number of panels here that are featured in the Posts section, we'll only focus on the differences</p>
      </li>

      <li data-class="page-edit1" data-text="Next">
        <p>On this particular page, there's a notice explaining that Wordpress has an autosave version of the page. This usually occurs if you were editing a page's content and quit the browser unexpectedly. Wordpress tries to recover what you were working on!</p>
      </li>

      <li data-class="page-edit2" data-text="Next">
        <p>Page Attributes is a new panel that is exclusive to the Edit Page section. It allows you to assign a different page layout (if applicable) to the page. In most cases, you won't need to edit this at all.</p>
      </li>

      <li data-class="page-edit3" data-text="Next">
        <p>Whilst the Featured Image panel appears on the Posts section, in this particular case the Featured Image could relate to a number of different parts of the page depending on your website's design. E.g. on some sites it may control the header image used on that particular page</p>
